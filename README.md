# Psychic-Game

This game is about the ability to outsmart the Computer!

** We want you to guess the letter that the Computer is thinking of in this game, do you have what it takes?

** Take a shot at guessing a letter, and see if the screen identifies if this letter has won against the Computer or if      you have lost and subsquently guessed the incorrect letter. You have 10 tries to make the guess!

** If you happen to guess incorrectly too many times, or if you win against the computer - the chances you get to try        will be reset to 10 and you will have the ability to try again.  

The trick of the game is to win more tries against the Computer than the Computer will win against you.


Good Luck!!
