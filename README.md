# **Psychic-Game**

### This game is about your ability to outsmart the Computer! :smiley:

* We want you to guess the letter that the Computer is thinking of in this game, do you have what it takes? 

    * Take a shot at guessing a letter, and see if the screen identifies if this letter has won against the Computer or if you have lost and subsquently guessed the incorrect letter. 
    
    _You have 10 tries to make the guess!_

* If you happen to guess incorrectly too many times, or if you win against the computer - the chances you get to try        will be reset to 10 and you will have the ability to try again.

**The trick of the game is to win more tries against the Computer than the Computer will win against you.**


**_Good Luck!!_**
